#Gini coefficient measure with a softmax threshold 
#for when the moving_gini(K,taumax), which takes a running window/measure of length taumax and returns a measure of dispersion from 0 to 1.
#make a softmax function cut off at user defined values
#Application: to model/compute next time step size given previous time step size.  It would suffice to have synchronous explicit updates followed by updates by implicit optimization.
#Spiral tip application: locations of concentrated time step resolution may give a high-res view of a spiral filament.

#could I use haptics to poke vorticity into a spiral filament??
#could electrophysiologists?
