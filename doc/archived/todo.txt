DONE(ish): make a repository for davi

in an .ipynb, test the correctness of an avi,
TODO: test/develop onestep(system) with explicit.py on a simplest use case my RA mesh/spherical mechanical system
TODO: collect ^those efforts into simplest explicit avi with 4 substeps per synchronous onestep. test against problem with known solution governed by the Hamilton's principle of least action
TODO: test against problem with known solution governed by the Lagrande-D'Alembert principle, that is dissipative
